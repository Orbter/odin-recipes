    <h3>How to make french toast</h3>
    <p>It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen you just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!</p>
    <h3>French Toast Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>White Bread:</strong> Thick-cut bread is the base for all French toast. Sturdy, dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture better than thin, airy ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> When it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The proteins solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together and ensures a rich texture. The fat, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> You can technically use any liquid to make French toast, though milk is most popular. Not only does milk add the necessary moisture, but the fat gives the batter extra richness. This recipe calls for whole milk because it creates the ideal texture. You can easily substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk – full-fat varieties will produce the creamiest consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla and cinnamon:</strong> The best French toast is warm, cozy, aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are optional, but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like it.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Don't skip the salt! Just a pinch won't affect the flavor. Salt helps break down the eggs, incorporate them into the batter, and prevents egg chunks in the finished product.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Like so many of the most decadent foods, the best French toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to burn, try frying the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Store French Toast</h3>
    <p>Let your leftover French toast cool completely, then place it in an airtight container (such as a zip-top bag or a reusable storage container). Store it in the fridge for about one to three days.</p>
    <h3>Can You Freeze French Toast?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze a big-batch of French toast for up to three months. Arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, freeze for at least four hours or up to overnight, then store frozen French toast in a freezer-safe container for two to three months. When you're ready to eat it, just throw it on a baking sheet and bake at 375°F until hot and cooked through, about 8-12 minutes. </p>
